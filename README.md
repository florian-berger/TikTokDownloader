# TikTokDownloader

This .NET MAUI application allows you to download videos with or without watermark as well as the sound of a video from TikTok. For this, just enter the URI (share or direct) of the video, hit the "Analyze" button and select the part you want to download.

The download is directly executed on your phone. So it is not dependent of any web services (besides TikTok itself). The app is NOT able to download private videos!
